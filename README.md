### Immigration to Canada, what itÂ shows?

> Canada is a country in the northern part of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometers (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area.

> In 2019, Canada admitted 341,180 permanent residents, compared to 321,055 the previous year. Among those admitted, 58% were economic immigrants and their accompanying immediate families; 27% were family class; 15% were either resettled refugees or protected persons or were in the humanitarian and other categories.

> In this notebook, we will look through the data that contains annual data on the flows of international immigrants as recorded by the countries of destination. In our case, our destination is Canada. We have data of Canadian immigrants from 1980 to 2013.
